# Bus Route Mapping Guide

This guide will help you in surveying bus routes and bus stops.

## Data to Capture
* The operator of the bus route
* The name of the bus route
* The route (gps trace) of teh bus route
* The bus stops
  * id reference number
  * bus stop name
  * which routes stop here
  * is there shelter, light, bench
  * other operators that stop here

## What to Do

1. Charge your batteries the night before!

1. Pick a bus route that hasn’t been mapped yet.

  Record your intent here:
  https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Mapathon/US_Summer_Mapathon_2017

1. Try to sit in the front right seat of the bus, so your location is nearest to the platform post, where people get onto the bus.

1. Take a selfie on the bus and tweet #mapathon. You can also Instagram. If you cc @OpenStreetMapUS we may even retweet. ;)

1. There are multiple parts to capturing data:

    As you ride the bus, record your location via GPS (e.g., maps.me or OSMAnd)
    Take notes of bus stop (e.g., pen and paper)
    Record a street image photo (e.g., Mapillary, OpenStreetCam)

1. If you capturing data digitally as in OSMTracker, in your editing app, label the bus stops as waypoints with "route # - seq #", where the sequence number is the bus stop in your trip. Don’t try to capture all the details at this time because the bus may get moving before you can save your data. Take notes on paper, and edit later.

1. Print out the [Bus Stop Survey Sheet](/bus-route-mapathon/bus-stops.html) and record your details there.

## Smart Phone Tools

* Android: [OSM Tracker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.guillaumin.android.osmtracker&hl=en), [Maps.me](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mapswithme.maps.pro&hl=en), [OSMAnd](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.osmand&hl=en), [Mapillary](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.mapillary&hl=en)
* iOS: Maps.me, OSMAnd, GoMap!, Mapillary

### OSMTracker

In OSMTracker, start a new GPS trace when you get onto the bus.  Take note of the bus stop where you started.
